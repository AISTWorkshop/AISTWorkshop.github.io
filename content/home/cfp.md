We invite novel papers from both academia and industry on AI applied to software testing that cover, but are not limited to, the following aspects:

- AI for test case design, test generation, test prioritization, and test reduction.
- AI for load testing and performance testing.
- AI for monitoring running systems or optimizing those systems.
- Explainable AI for software testing.
- Case studies, experience reports, benchmarking, and best practices.
- New ideas, emerging results, and position papers.
- Industrial case studies with lessons learned or practical guidelines.

Papers can be of one of the following types:

- Full Papers (max. 8 pages): Papers presenting mature research results or industrial practices.
- Short Papers (max. 4 pages): Papers presenting new ideas or preliminary results.
- Tool Papers (max. 4 pages): Papers presenting an AI-enabled testing tool. Tool papers should communicate the purpose and use cases for the tool. The tool should be made available (either free to download or for purchase).
- Position Papers (max. 2 pages): Position statements and open challenges, intended to spark discussion or debate.

The reviewing process is single blind. Therefore, papers do not need to be anonymized. Papers must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication format and should be submitted via EasyChair using the following link: **To Be Added**

All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Submissions will be evaluated according to the relevance and originality of the work and on their ability to generate discussions between the participants of the workshop. Each submission will be reviewed by three reviewers, and all accepted papers will be published as part of the ICST proceedings. For all accepted papers, at least one author must register in the workshop and present the paper.
