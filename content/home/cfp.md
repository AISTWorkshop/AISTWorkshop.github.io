We invite novel papers from academia and industry on AI applied to software testing. 

Papers can be of one of the following types:
 - **Full-papers (max. 8 pages):** Papers presenting mature research results or industrial practices.
 - **Short-papers (max. 4 pages):** Papers presenting new ideas, preliminary results, position statements, and open challenges.

All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. For all accepted papers, at least one author must register in the workshop and present the paper.

Papers presented at AIST will be published through the IEEE digital library.
