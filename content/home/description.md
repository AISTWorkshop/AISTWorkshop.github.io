The application of AI techniques in software testing is in its early stages. In the last few years, software developers have increasingly adopted novel techniques to ease the development cycle, namely the testing phase, by means of autonomous testing and/or optimization of repetitive and tedious activities.

AI can transform software testing by supporting efficient testing activities and increasing automation, which ultimately leads to a reduction in testing costs and improvements in software quality. The AIST workshop aims to gather researchers and practitioners to present, discuss, and foster collaboration on novel and up-to-date R&D focused on the application of AI in software testing, with an inclusive view of the many perspectives and topics under the AI umbrella.
