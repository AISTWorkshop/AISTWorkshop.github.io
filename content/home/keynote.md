**Testing and Development Challenges for Complex Cyber-Physical Systems: Insights from the COSMOS H2020 Project**

[Sebastiano Panichella](https://spanichella.github.io/)

**Abstract:** Over the past decade, the development of Cyber-Physical systems (CPSs) has enabled significant advancements in healthcare, avionics, automotive, railway, and robotics. Notably, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Self-driving Cars (SDCs) have emerged as the frontrunners in avionics and automotive sectors, showcasing autonomous capabilities through onboard cameras and sensors. These systems have opened doors to a range of applications, including crop monitoring, medical and food delivery, and 3D reconstruction of archaeological and space exploration sites. However, the state-of-the-art technology still lacks solutions that can operate in real-life missions due to limited testing solutions, which remains the biggest challenge.

This keynote will discuss the testing and development challenges faced by the COSMOS H2020 Project (https://www.cosmos-devops.org/) in the context of complex CPSs. COSMOS brings together a consortium of four academic and eight industrial partners, with organizations from healthcare, avionics, automotive, utility, and railway sectors. The talk will focus on the studies conducted by COSMOS to identify the types of bugs affecting CPSs and the safety-critical issues of UAVs, along with the selection and prioritization strategies proposed for cost-effective regression testing of SDCs. Additionally, the talk will cover automated testing approaches for UAVs, addressing the issue of the "Reality-gap‚Äù.

The keynote will also provide success stories and lessons learned from applying these testing approaches in industrial settings, and outline future directions for generic CPSs and specific use cases such as UAVs and SDCs. Join us for an insightful discussion on the challenges and solutions of testing and developing CPSs in real-life scenarios.


**Biography:** Sebastiano Panichella is a Computer Science Researcher at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). His main research goal is to conduct industrial research, involving both industrial and academic collaborations, to sustain the Internet of Things (IoT) vision where future "smart cities" will be characterized by millions of smart systems (e.g., cyber-physical systems such as drones, and other autonomous vehicles) connected over the internet, composed by AI components, and/or controlled by complex embedded software implemented for the cloud. His research interests are in the domain of Software Engineering (SE), cloud computing (CC), and Data Science (DS). Currently, he is the technical coordinator of H2020 and Innosuisse projects concerning DevOps for Complex Cyber-physical Systems. He authored or co-authored around nighty papers that appeared in International Conferences and Journals.  
This research works involved studies with industrial and open projects and received best paper awards or best paper nominations. He serves and has served as a program committee member for various International conferences and as a reviewer for various international journals in the field of software engineering.
